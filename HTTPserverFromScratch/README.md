# HTTP Server from Scratch using C++

## Introduction

Welcome to another project that can take our C++ programming skills to one step better than yesterday.

Here we implement an HTTP server from scratch using C++!!

**HTTP(Hyper Text Transfer Protocol)** is the protocol that powers the web. In this project, we 'll build a HTTP server that's capable of handling simple GET/POST requests,
serving files and handling multiple concurrent connections. <br/>

Along the way, we'll learn about TCP connections, HTTP headers, HTTP verbs, handling multiple connections and more.
